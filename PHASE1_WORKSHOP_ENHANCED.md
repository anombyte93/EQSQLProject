## üìö Before We Begin: Essential Concepts

### What Is a Database?

Think of a database like a super-powered filing cabinet that:
- **Never loses papers** (data persistence)
- **Won't let you file things wrong** (constraints)
- **Can find anything instantly** (indexing)
- **Lets multiple people use it simultaneously** (concurrency)
- **Keeps a history of all changes** (audit trails)

### Spreadsheet vs Database: A Critical Comparison

| Aspect | Spreadsheet (Excel) | Database (PostgreSQL) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Multiple users** | Often corrupts with simultaneous editing | Handles thousands of users safely |
| **Data validation** | Manual, easy to bypass | Automatic, enforced by rules |
| **Relationships** | VLOOKUP hell, breaks easily | Foreign keys maintain integrity |
| **Size limits** | ~1 million rows max | Billions of rows, no problem |
| **Audit trail** | Who changed what? Good luck! | Every change can be logged |
| **Backups** | Save As... and pray | Automated, point-in-time recovery |

**Real-world example**: A company stored customer data in Excel. An intern accidentally sorted one column without the others, mixing up all customer orders. It took 3 weeks to fix. With a database, this would be impossible.

### Understanding Tables, Rows, and Columns

```
Think of it like this:
- DATABASE = Filing Cabinet
- TABLE = Drawer in the cabinet
- COLUMN = Type of information (name, phone, etc.)
- ROW = One complete record (one person's full info)
- CELL = Single piece of data
```

### What Is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is how we talk to databases. Think of it as:
- **English-like commands** that the database understands
- **Universal language** (works on PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
- **Declarative** - you say WHAT you want, not HOW to get it

Example in plain English vs SQL:
```
English: "Show me all active projects with budgets over $1 million"
SQL:     SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = 'Active' AND budget > 1000000
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Materials & Setup Check

### Required Software
- **PostgreSQL 14+** ([Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))
- **Terminal/Command Prompt** (comes with your OS)
- **Text editor** (VS Code, Notepad++, vim, nano - any will work)
- **This worksheet** (save it locally as PHASE1_GUIDE.md)

### Quick Installation Check

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
psql --version
```

**What this does**: Checks if PostgreSQL is installed and accessible

**Expected output**: Something like `psql (PostgreSQL) 14.5`

**If it doesn't work**:
- **Windows**: Add PostgreSQL's bin folder to your PATH environment variable
- **Mac**: Try `brew install postgresql` if you have Homebrew
- **Linux**: Try `sudo apt-get install postgresql` (Debian/Ubuntu)

---

## Part 0: Understanding What We're Building

### The Business Scenario

**ArchitectPro** is a growing architecture firm with problems:
- They track projects in Excel, leading to version conflicts
- Client contact info is scattered across email and spreadsheets
- They can't easily see which employee works on which project
- Budget tracking is manual and error-prone
- They have no audit trail for changes

Your job: Build them a proper database system.

### The Data We Need to Track

Before writing any code, let's understand the business:

**CLIENTS** - Companies that hire ArchitectPro
- Company name (can't be empty)
- Email for contracts (must be unique)
- Phone number (optional)
- Physical address (for site visits)
- Country (for tax purposes)
- Active status (some clients are inactive)

**EMPLOYEES** - People who work at ArchitectPro
- Name and email (email must be unique)
- Role (Architect, Engineer, Project Manager)
- Department and hire date
- Salary (confidential!)
- Login tracking (for security)

**PROJECTS** - Work being done for clients
- Which client it's for (critical relationship!)
- Project name and type
- Budget and timeline
- Current status
- Who created it (for accountability)

### üí≠ Think About It First

Before we create tables, consider:
- What happens if we delete a client that has projects?
- How do we ensure email addresses are valid?
- What if someone tries to set a negative salary?
- How do we track who changed what?

Keep these questions in mind as we build our solution.

## Part 1: Connecting to PostgreSQL

### Step 1.1: Your First Database Connection

#### Understanding Database Servers

PostgreSQL runs as a **server** on your computer - a program that's always running in the background, waiting for connections. Think of it like:
- **Server** = Restaurant that's always open
- **psql** = You walking into the restaurant
- **Database** = Different menu sections you can order from

Let's connect:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

**What each part means**:
- `psql` = The PostgreSQL client program (your way to talk to the server)
- `-U` = "User" flag (who you're logging in as)
- `postgres` = The superuser account (like "admin" or "root")

**What happens when you run this**:
1. psql program starts
2. Connects to PostgreSQL server on your computer
3. Logs you in as the 'postgres' user
4. Shows prompt: `postgres=#`

**Common problems and fixes**:

‚ùå **Error: "psql: command not found"**
- PostgreSQL isn't in your PATH
- Fix: Find where PostgreSQL is installed and add its bin folder to PATH

‚ùå **Error: "FATAL: password authentication failed"**
- You need to provide a password
- Fix: `psql -U postgres -W` (capital W prompts for password)

‚ùå **Error: "could not connect to server"**
- PostgreSQL server isn't running
- Fix Windows: Start 'postgresql-x64-14' service
- Fix Mac/Linux: `sudo service postgresql start`

### Step 1.2: Create Your Project Database

Now we'll create a dedicated database for our project:

```sql
-- This is a SQL comment. Everything after -- is ignored by the database
-- Comments help document your code!

CREATE DATABASE arch_firm;
```

**What this does**:
- Creates a new, empty database named 'arch_firm'
- Like creating a new, empty filing cabinet

**What happens behind the scenes**:
1. PostgreSQL creates a new directory on disk
2. Initializes system tables (metadata about your data)
3. Sets up transaction logs
4. Configures access permissions

Let's verify it worked:

```sql
\l
```

**What this does**:
- `\l` is a psql meta-command (not SQL)
- Lists all databases on the server
- You should see 'arch_firm' in the list

**Understanding the output**:
```
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+
 arch_firm | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
```
- **Name**: Database name
- **Owner**: Who can modify the database structure
- **Encoding**: How text is stored (UTF8 = supports emojis! üòä)
- **Collate/Ctype**: How text is sorted and compared

Now connect to your new database:

```sql
\c arch_firm
```

**What this does**:
- Switches your connection from current database to 'arch_firm'
- Like closing one filing cabinet and opening another

**You'll see**: `You are now connected to database "arch_firm" as user "postgres"`

Verify where you are:

```sql
SELECT current_database(), current_user, version();
```

**What this query does**:
- `SELECT` = "Show me"
- `current_database()` = Function that returns database name
- `current_user` = Variable containing your username
- `version()` = Function showing PostgreSQL version
- Semicolon (;) = End of statement (like period in English)

### üìù Checkpoint Understanding

**Question**: Why do we create a separate database instead of using the default 'postgres' database?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

We create separate databases to:
1. **Isolate projects** - Each application gets its own database
2. **Security** - Limit what each application can access
3. **Organization** - Like having separate folders for different projects
4. **Safety** - Mistakes in one database don't affect others
5. **Backup/Restore** - Can backup individual databases

The 'postgres' database is like the 'Administrator' account - you shouldn't use it for regular work.
</details>

## Part 2: Understanding Security from Day One

### Step 2.1: Why Security Matters (Even in Development)

**Common beginner mistake**: "It's just a learning project, security doesn't matter"

**Reality check**:
- 43% of cyber attacks target small businesses
- Average data breach costs $4.35 million
- Most breaches exploit basic vulnerabilities
- Good security habits must start from day one

### Step 2.2: Setting Up Environment Variables

Instead of hardcoding passwords, we'll use environment variables:

```bash
# First, exit psql temporarily
\q

# Create a project folder
mkdir ~/architectpro_project
cd ~/architectpro_project

# Create environment file
touch .env
```

Now edit `.env` with your text editor and add:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost        # Where the database server is
DB_PORT=5432             # Standard PostgreSQL port
DB_NAME=arch_firm        # Our database name
DB_USER=postgres         # Username (we'll create a better one later)
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword # CHANGE THIS to your actual password

# Never commit this file to Git!
```

**Why environment variables?**
1. **Passwords stay out of code** - Code goes to GitHub, passwords don't
2. **Different settings per environment** - Dev/Test/Prod can differ
3. **Easy to rotate** - Change password in one place
4. **Industry standard** - Every company does this

Create a `.gitignore` file:

```bash
echo ".env
*.backup
*.log
.DS_Store" > .gitignore
```

**What we're ignoring and why**:
- `.env` - Contains secrets
- `*.backup` - Database backups (can be huge)
- `*.log` - Log files (may contain sensitive data)
- `.DS_Store` - Mac system files (useless)

### üö® Security Alert: What Happens If You Leak Credentials?

**Real scenario**: Developer accidentally commits .env to GitHub

**What attackers do**:
1. Bots scan GitHub for exposed credentials (within seconds!)
2. Try credentials on your database/server
3. If successful: steal data, install cryptominers, ransomware

**If it happens to you**:
1. Immediately change all exposed passwords
2. Check access logs for unauthorized access
3. Use GitHub's "Remove sensitive data" guide
4. Enable 2FA everywhere

---

## Part 3: Creating Your First Table (With Deep Understanding)

### Step 3.1: What Is a Table?

A **table** is a structured container for data, like a spreadsheet with rules:
- **Columns** define what type of data can be stored
- **Rows** contain actual data
- **Constraints** enforce business rules
- **Indexes** make searches fast

### Step 3.2: Planning the Clients Table

Before creating, let's think about what we need:

```
CLIENTS TABLE DESIGN:
- client_id: Unique identifier (why not use company name?)
- company_name: The client's business name
- contact_email: For sending contracts
- phone: For urgent contact
- address: For site visits
- country: For tax/legal purposes
- created_at: When we added them
- updated_at: When record last changed
- is_active: Soft delete capability
```

### Step 3.3: Create the Clients Table

Connect to your database:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d arch_firm
```

First, let's understand data types:

```sql
-- Let's see available data types
\dT
```

Common types you'll use:
- **INTEGER**: Whole numbers (-2B to +2B)
- **SERIAL**: Auto-incrementing integer (1, 2, 3...)
- **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length text up to n characters
- **TEXT**: Unlimited length text
- **DECIMAL(p,s)**: Precise numbers (p digits, s after decimal)
- **DATE**: Calendar date (no time)
- **TIMESTAMP**: Date and time
- **BOOLEAN**: true/false

Now create the table:

```sql
-- First, let's enable helpful extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";  -- For generating UUIDs
```

**What's an extension?**
- Add-on features for PostgreSQL
- `uuid-ossp` lets us generate unique identifiers
- UUIDs are better than numbers for APIs (can't guess next ID)

```sql
-- Create the clients table with explanations for each line
CREATE TABLE clients (
    -- Primary key: Unique identifier for each row
    -- SERIAL means: Start at 1, increment by 1 automatically
    -- PRIMARY KEY means: Must be unique, can't be NULL, creates index
    client_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

    -- Company name: Required field (NOT NULL)
    -- VARCHAR(200) means: Max 200 characters (prevents runaway data)
    company_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,

    -- Email: Must be unique across all clients
    -- UNIQUE creates an index and prevents duplicates
    contact_email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

    -- Phone: Optional (no NOT NULL)
    -- VARCHAR better than INTEGER for phone (leading zeros, extensions)
    phone VARCHAR(20),

    -- Address: TEXT type for unlimited length
    -- No constraint because international addresses vary wildly
    address TEXT,

    -- Country: Required with a default value
    -- DEFAULT means: If not specified, use this value
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Australia',

    -- Timestamps: Track record history
    -- CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is a function that returns now()
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    -- Soft delete: Instead of deleting, mark as inactive
    -- BOOLEAN is true/false, DEFAULT true means active by default
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,

    -- Advanced: Constraint to validate email format using regex
    -- ~* means: case-insensitive regex match
    CONSTRAINT valid_email CHECK (
        contact_email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$'
    )
);
```

**Let's break down what just happened**:

1. **CREATE TABLE clients**: Made a new container for client data
2. **SERIAL PRIMARY KEY**:
   - SERIAL = Auto-incrementing number
   - PRIMARY KEY = This field identifies each row uniquely
   - Automatically creates an index for fast lookups
3. **NOT NULL**: This field cannot be empty
4. **UNIQUE**: No two rows can have the same value
5. **DEFAULT**: If no value provided, use this
6. **CHECK constraint**: Custom validation rule

Let's examine what was created:

```sql
-- See all tables
\dt

-- Describe the clients table structure
\d clients
```

**Understanding the output**:
```
                     Table "public.clients"
    Column     |          Type           | Nullable |   Default
---------------+------------------------+----------+-------------
 client_id     | integer                | not null | nextval('...')
 company_name  | character varying(200) | not null |
 contact_email | character varying(255) | not null |
```

- **nextval(...)**: Function that generates next ID number
- **character varying**: Same as VARCHAR
- **Nullable**: Whether NULL is allowed

### Step 3.4: Test the Constraints (Learning from Errors)

**Important**: Errors are good! They prevent bad data. Let's trigger some intentionally:

```sql
-- Test 1: Try to insert without required field
INSERT INTO clients (contact_email)
VALUES ('test@example.com');
```

**Expected error**:
```
ERROR: null value in column "company_name" violates not-null constraint
```

**What this means**:
- You tried to insert a row without a company name
- The NOT NULL constraint blocked it
- Your database is protecting itself from incomplete data!

```sql
-- Test 2: Try to insert invalid email
INSERT INTO clients (company_name, contact_email)
VALUES ('Test Company', 'not-an-email');
```

**Expected error**:
```
ERROR: new row for relation "clients" violates check constraint "valid_email"
```

**What this means**:
- The email format check (regex) failed
- Prevents typos and invalid data entry
- Saves hours of data cleanup later!

```sql
-- Test 3: Try to insert duplicate email
INSERT INTO clients (company_name, contact_email)
VALUES ('Company A', 'test@example.com');

-- If successful, try again:
INSERT INTO clients (company_name, contact_email)
VALUES ('Company B', 'test@example.com');
```

**Expected error** (on second insert):
```
ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "clients_contact_email_key"
```

**What this means**:
- Email already exists in the table
- UNIQUE constraint prevented duplicate
- Ensures each client has distinct contact email

### üìù Understanding Check: Constraints

**Question**: Why use constraints instead of checking data in application code?

<details>
<summary>Think first, then click for answer</summary>

Constraints are better because:

1. **Database is the last line of defense** - Even if app has bugs, data stays clean
2. **Multiple applications** - All apps using the database get protection
3. **Performance** - Database checks are faster than application code
4. **Can't be bypassed** - Developers can't accidentally skip validation
5. **Self-documenting** - Constraints show business rules in schema

Example: Without constraints, one buggy script could insert negative salaries, invalid emails, or orphaned records. With constraints, it's impossible.
</details>

## Part 4: Creating Related Tables (Understanding Relationships)

### Step 4.1: Why Relationships Matter

Imagine storing everything in one giant table:
```
| company_name | project_name | employee_name | salary | budget |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| ABC Corp     | Tower        | John          | 80000  | 1000000|
| ABC Corp     | Tower        | Jane          | 90000  | 1000000|
| ABC Corp     | Mall         | John          | 80000  | 2000000|
```

**Problems with this approach**:
- **Redundancy**: "ABC Corp" repeated everywhere
- **Update anomalies**: Change company name? Update everywhere!
- **Inconsistency**: Easy to have "ABC Corp" and "ABC Corporation"
- **Wasted space**: Storing same data multiple times

**Solution**: Separate tables with relationships!

### Step 4.2: Create the Employees Table

```sql
-- Create employees table with detailed explanations
CREATE TABLE employees (
    -- Primary key for unique identification
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

    -- Email must be unique (no two employees can share email)
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

    -- Names are required
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

    -- Role in the company
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

    -- Department with sensible default
    department VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Architecture',

    -- Hire date defaults to today if not specified
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,

    -- Salary must be positive (CHECK constraint)
    -- DECIMAL(10,2) means: up to 10 digits, 2 after decimal point
    -- Why DECIMAL not FLOAT? DECIMAL is exact, FLOAT can have rounding errors
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (salary > 0),

    -- Soft delete capability
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,

    -- Security tracking fields
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

    -- Business logic: Salary must be reasonable
    -- This prevents data entry errors like $80 or $80000000
    CONSTRAINT reasonable_salary CHECK (salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 500000)
);
```

**Deep dive: Why these specific constraints?**

1. **Email unique**: Prevents duplicate accounts
2. **Salary positive**: Negative salary makes no sense
3. **Reasonable salary range**: Catches typos (meant 80000, typed 80)
4. **Failed login tracking**: Security monitoring
5. **Soft delete**: Keep record for audit even when employee leaves

Let's verify the table:

```sql
\d employees
```

### Step 4.3: Create Projects Table with Foreign Keys

Now the critical part - linking projects to clients:

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    -- Primary key
    project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

    -- Foreign key to clients table - THIS IS CRUCIAL!
    -- References means: This value MUST exist in clients.client_id
    client_id INTEGER NOT NULL,

    -- Project details
    project_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    project_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

    -- Budget with constraint
    budget DECIMAL(12,2) CHECK (budget > 0),

    -- Timeline
    start_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    end_date DATE,  -- NULL allowed (project ongoing)

    -- Status tracking
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Planning',

    -- Who created this project (link to employees)
    created_by INTEGER,

    -- FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS - The magic of relational databases!
    CONSTRAINT fk_client
        FOREIGN KEY (client_id)
        REFERENCES clients(client_id)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT,
        -- RESTRICT means: Can't delete client if they have projects
        -- Other options:
        -- CASCADE: Delete projects when client deleted
        -- SET NULL: Set to NULL when client deleted

    CONSTRAINT fk_creator
        FOREIGN KEY (created_by)
        REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL,
        -- If employee deleted, keep project but clear creator

    -- Business logic constraints
    CONSTRAINT valid_dates
        CHECK (end_date IS NULL OR end_date > start_date),
        -- End date must be after start date (or NULL)

    CONSTRAINT valid_status
        CHECK (status IN ('Planning', 'Active', 'On Hold', 'Completed', 'Cancelled')),
        -- Status must be one of these values

    CONSTRAINT valid_project_type
        CHECK (project_type IN ('Residential', 'Commercial', 'Industrial', 'Public', 'Mixed-Use'))
        -- Project type must be from this list
);
```

### Step 4.4: Understanding Foreign Keys

**What's a foreign key?**
- A field that must match a value in another table
- Creates a "relationship" between tables
- Enforces "referential integrity"

**Analogy**:
- Think of it like a membership card number
- You can't use a membership number that doesn't exist
- The gym (database) checks if you're really a member

Let's test foreign key constraints:

```sql
-- This will FAIL - no client with ID 999
INSERT INTO projects (client_id, project_name, project_type, budget)
VALUES (999, 'Ghost Project', 'Residential', 100000);
```

**Expected error**:
```
ERROR: insert or update on table "projects" violates foreign key constraint "fk_client"
DETAIL: Key (client_id)=(999) is not present in table "clients".
```

**What this means**:
- You tried to create a project for client 999
- No client with ID 999 exists
- Foreign key prevented orphaned data!

### Step 4.5: Create Indexes for Performance

```sql
-- Indexes make searches faster (like book index)
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_client ON projects(client_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_status ON projects(status)
    WHERE status = 'Active';  -- Partial index, only for active projects
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_email ON employees(email);
```

**What are indexes?**
- Like the index in a book - helps find data quickly
- Trade-off: Faster reads, slightly slower writes
- Primary keys automatically get indexes

**When to create indexes**:
- Columns you search by frequently (WHERE clauses)
- Columns you join on
- Columns you sort by (ORDER BY)

Check what indexes exist:

```sql
\di
```

### üí° Concept Check: Referential Integrity

**Scenario**: What happens if you try to delete a client that has projects?

<details>
<summary>Think about it, then click</summary>

With our `ON DELETE RESTRICT` setting:
1. The deletion will be blocked
2. You'll get an error about foreign key violation
3. The client record stays intact
4. The projects remain safe

This prevents accidentally deleting important data. In real business:
- You might first need to complete/cancel all projects
- Or transfer projects to another client
- Or archive everything together

Without foreign keys, you could delete the client and have "orphaned" projects pointing to nothing!
</details>

## Part 5: Adding Data (The Right Way)

### Step 5.1: Understanding INSERT Statements

The INSERT statement adds new rows to a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

**Important principles**:
1. **Specify columns explicitly** - Don't rely on column order
2. **Match data types** - String needs quotes, numbers don't
3. **Respect constraints** - NULL only where allowed
4. **Use transactions** - Group related inserts

### Step 5.2: Insert Clients

```sql
-- Let's start with a single client to understand the process
INSERT INTO clients (company_name, contact_email, phone, address, country)
VALUES (
    'Westfield Group',           -- Company name
    'contracts@westfield.com.au', -- Unique email
    '+61-2-9358-7000',           -- International format
    '85 Castlereagh St, Sydney NSW 2000', -- Full address
    'Australia'                  -- Country
);
```

**What happens when you run this**:
1. PostgreSQL validates all constraints
2. Generates next client_id (probably 1)
3. Sets created_at to current time
4. Sets is_active to true (default)
5. Adds row to table
6. Updates indexes
7. Returns: `INSERT 0 1` (0 is OID, 1 is rows inserted)

Check what was inserted:

```sql
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

**Understanding SELECT * (and why to avoid it in production)**:
- `*` means "all columns"
- Good for exploration, bad for production (why?)
- Better to specify exact columns you need

Now insert multiple clients efficiently:

```sql
-- Insert multiple rows in one statement (more efficient)
INSERT INTO clients (company_name, contact_email, phone, address, country) VALUES
('Lendlease Corporation', 'info@lendlease.com', '+61-2-9236-6111', 'Level 14, Tower Three, Barangaroo', 'Australia'),
('Mirvac Limited', 'enquiries@mirvac.com', '+61-2-9080-8000', '200 George St, Sydney NSW 2000', 'Australia'),
('Crown Resorts', 'projects@crownresorts.com.au', '+61-3-9292-8888', '8 Whiteman St, Melbourne VIC 3006', 'Australia'),
('Stockland Property', 'development@stockland.com.au', '+61-2-9035-2000', '133 Castlereagh St, Sydney NSW 2000', 'Australia');
```

**Why insert multiple rows at once?**
- One transaction instead of many
- Less network overhead
- Atomic - all succeed or all fail
- Much faster for bulk data

Verify with better SELECT:

```sql
-- Better than SELECT * - specify what you need
SELECT
    client_id,
    company_name,
    country,
    created_at
FROM clients
ORDER BY client_id;
```

### Step 5.3: Insert Employees

```sql
-- First, let's think about the data
-- Salary is sensitive - in production, might be encrypted
-- Email must be unique - what if someone mistypes?

INSERT INTO employees (email, first_name, last_name, role, department, hire_date, salary) VALUES
('sarah.chen@architectpro.com', 'Sarah', 'Chen', 'Principal Architect', 'Architecture', '2019-03-15', 150000),
('james.wilson@architectpro.com', 'James', 'Wilson', 'Project Manager', 'Management', '2020-07-01', 95000),
('maria.garcia@architectpro.com', 'Maria', 'Garcia', 'Senior Architect', 'Architecture', '2018-11-20', 110000),
('alex.kumar@architectpro.com', 'Alex', 'Kumar', 'Junior Architect', 'Architecture', '2022-01-10', 65000),
('emma.brown@architectpro.com', 'Emma', 'Brown', 'Structural Engineer', 'Engineering', '2021-05-15', 85000);
```

Verify with aggregation:

```sql
-- Count by department
SELECT
    department,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
    MIN(salary) as min_salary,
    MAX(salary) as max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

**What this query does**:
- **GROUP BY**: Combines rows with same department
- **COUNT(*)**: Counts rows in each group
- **AVG/MIN/MAX**: Calculate statistics per group
- **ORDER BY ... DESC**: Sort highest to lowest

### Step 5.4: Insert Projects (With Foreign Keys)

Now the critical part - projects must reference valid clients and employees:

```sql
-- First, let's see what client and employee IDs we have
SELECT client_id, company_name FROM clients;
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;

-- Now insert projects using those IDs
INSERT INTO projects (client_id, project_name, project_type, budget, start_date, end_date, status, created_by) VALUES
(1, 'Westfield Sydney Tower Renovation', 'Commercial', 2500000.00, '2024-01-15', '2024-12-31', 'Active', 1),
(2, 'Barangaroo South Residential Complex', 'Residential', 8000000.00, '2024-03-01', '2025-06-30', 'Planning', 2),
(3, 'Mirvac Office Sustainability Retrofit', 'Commercial', 1500000.00, '2024-02-01', '2024-08-31', 'Active', 3),
(4, 'Crown Casino Hotel Extension', 'Mixed-Use', 12000000.00, '2024-06-01', '2025-12-31', 'Planning', 1),
(5, 'Stockland Green Shopping Centre', 'Commercial', 5000000.00, '2024-04-15', '2025-03-31', 'Active', 2);
```

**Important**: We're using hard-coded IDs (1, 2, 3...). In production, you'd:
- Look up IDs dynamically
- Use transactions to ensure consistency
- Maybe use natural keys or UUIDs

### Step 5.5: Understanding Transactions

Transactions ensure multiple operations succeed or fail together:

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Try to insert a project
INSERT INTO projects (client_id, project_name, project_type, budget, status)
VALUES (1, 'Test Project', 'Commercial', 500000, 'Planning');

-- Check it's there
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE project_name = 'Test Project';

-- Undo everything since BEGIN
ROLLBACK;

-- Check it's gone
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE project_name = 'Test Project';
```

**What happened?**
- **BEGIN**: Started tracking changes
- **INSERT**: Added row (temporarily)
- **ROLLBACK**: Undid all changes since BEGIN
- Row never permanently saved!

Alternative ending:
```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO projects (client_id, project_name, project_type, budget, status)
VALUES (1, 'Real Project', 'Commercial', 500000, 'Planning');
COMMIT;  -- Makes changes permanent
```

**When to use transactions**:
- Multiple related inserts
- Complex updates
- Any operation that must be "all or nothing"

### üìä Data Verification Queries

Let's make sure our data is correct:

```sql
-- Count rows in each table
SELECT
    'clients' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM clients
UNION ALL
SELECT 'employees', COUNT(*) FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT 'projects', COUNT(*) FROM projects;

-- Check for any constraint violations we might have missed
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE client_id NOT IN (SELECT client_id FROM clients);
-- Should return 0

-- Check date logic
SELECT project_name, start_date, end_date
FROM projects
WHERE end_date <= start_date;
-- Should return 0 rows
```

---

## Part 6: Querying Data (The Power of SQL)

### Step 6.1: Basic SELECT Queries

The SELECT statement is how we ask questions of our data:

```sql
-- Basic structure
SELECT columns     -- What to show
FROM table         -- Where to look
WHERE conditions   -- Which rows
ORDER BY columns   -- How to sort
LIMIT number;      -- How many
```

Let's start simple and build up:

```sql
-- 1. Everything from a table (avoid in production!)
SELECT * FROM clients;

-- 2. Specific columns (better)
SELECT company_name, contact_email FROM clients;

-- 3. With conditions
SELECT company_name, contact_email
FROM clients
WHERE country = 'Australia';

-- 4. With sorting
SELECT company_name, contact_email
FROM clients
WHERE country = 'Australia'
ORDER BY company_name;

-- 5. With limit (pagination)
SELECT company_name, contact_email
FROM clients
WHERE country = 'Australia'
ORDER BY company_name
LIMIT 3;
```

**Understanding WHERE clauses**:

```sql
-- Equality
WHERE status = 'Active'

-- Inequality
WHERE budget > 1000000

-- Range
WHERE budget BETWEEN 1000000 AND 5000000

-- In a list
WHERE status IN ('Active', 'Planning')

-- Pattern matching (% = any characters)
WHERE project_name LIKE '%Tower%'

-- NULL checking (special syntax!)
WHERE end_date IS NULL  -- NOT "= NULL"

-- Combining conditions
WHERE status = 'Active' AND budget > 1000000
WHERE status = 'Active' OR status = 'Planning'
WHERE status = 'Active' AND (budget > 1000000 OR client_id = 1)
```

### Step 6.2: JOIN Operations (Combining Tables)

JOINs are what make relational databases powerful:

```sql
-- Problem: Show project names with client names
-- Projects table has client_id, not client name
-- Solution: JOIN!

SELECT
    p.project_name,
    p.budget,
    c.company_name  -- From clients table!
FROM projects p     -- 'p' is an alias
JOIN clients c      -- 'c' is an alias
    ON p.client_id = c.client_id;  -- How they connect
```

**What happens during a JOIN**:
1. Database looks at each project row
2. Finds matching client using client_id
3. Combines columns from both tables
4. Returns combined result

**Types of JOINs explained**:

```sql
-- INNER JOIN (or just JOIN): Only matching rows
SELECT p.project_name, c.company_name
FROM projects p
INNER JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.client_id;
-- Only shows projects that have a valid client

-- LEFT JOIN: All from left table, matching from right
SELECT c.company_name, p.project_name
FROM clients c
LEFT JOIN projects p ON c.client_id = p.client_id;
-- Shows ALL clients, even those without projects (NULL for project_name)

-- RIGHT JOIN: All from right table, matching from left
-- (Rarely used, can always rewrite as LEFT JOIN)

-- FULL OUTER JOIN: All from both tables
-- Shows everything, with NULLs where no match
```

**Practical JOIN example - Project Dashboard**:

```sql
-- Project details with client and creator info
SELECT
    p.project_name,
    p.budget,
    p.status,
    p.start_date,
    c.company_name as client_name,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name as created_by_name
FROM projects p
JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.client_id
LEFT JOIN employees e ON p.created_by = e.employee_id
WHERE p.status = 'Active'
ORDER BY p.budget DESC;
```

**Why LEFT JOIN for employees?**
- Some projects might have NULL created_by
- LEFT JOIN still shows those projects
- INNER JOIN would exclude them

### Step 6.3: Aggregation and Grouping

Aggregation answers questions like "how many?" and "what's the total?":

```sql
-- Simple aggregates
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;  -- How many projects?
SELECT SUM(budget) FROM projects WHERE status = 'Active';  -- Total active budget
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;  -- Average salary
SELECT MAX(budget) FROM projects;  -- Biggest project
SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employees;  -- Who was hired first?
```

**GROUP BY - Aggregates by category**:

```sql
-- Projects by status
SELECT
    status,
    COUNT(*) as project_count,
    SUM(budget) as total_budget,
    AVG(budget) as avg_budget
FROM projects
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY total_budget DESC;
```

**What GROUP BY does**:
1. Splits rows into groups (by status)
2. Calculates aggregates for each group
3. Returns one row per group

**HAVING - WHERE for groups**:

```sql
-- Find project types with total budget > 5 million
SELECT
    project_type,
    COUNT(*) as project_count,
    SUM(budget) as total_budget
FROM projects
GROUP BY project_type
HAVING SUM(budget) > 5000000;  -- HAVING filters groups
```

**WHERE vs HAVING**:
- WHERE filters rows before grouping
- HAVING filters groups after grouping

### Step 6.4: Practical Business Queries

Let's answer real business questions:

```sql
-- 1. Which clients give us the most revenue?
SELECT
    c.company_name,
    COUNT(p.project_id) as project_count,
    SUM(p.budget) as total_revenue
FROM clients c
LEFT JOIN projects p ON c.client_id = p.client_id
GROUP BY c.client_id, c.company_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC NULLS LAST;

-- 2. Employee utilization (who's working on what?)
SELECT
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name as employee_name,
    COUNT(p.project_id) as projects_created
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN projects p ON e.employee_id = p.created_by
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name
ORDER BY projects_created DESC;

-- 3. Project timeline analysis
SELECT
    project_name,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    end_date - start_date as duration_days,
    CASE
        WHEN end_date < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'Overdue'
        WHEN end_date < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'Due Soon'
        ELSE 'On Track'
    END as timeline_status
FROM projects
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

### üß† Query Challenge

**Challenge**: Find clients who have no active projects

<details>
<summary>Try it yourself first, then check the solution</summary>

```sql
-- Solution using LEFT JOIN and WHERE
SELECT
    c.company_name,
    c.contact_email
FROM clients c
LEFT JOIN projects p ON c.client_id = p.client_id
    AND p.status = 'Active'  -- Join condition, not WHERE
WHERE p.project_id IS NULL;     -- No matching active project

-- Alternative using NOT EXISTS
SELECT company_name, contact_email
FROM clients c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM projects p
    WHERE p.client_id = c.client_id
    AND p.status = 'Active'
);
```

Both queries find the same answer but work differently:
- LEFT JOIN creates all combinations then filters
- NOT EXISTS stops searching once it finds a match (can be faster)
</details>

## Part 7: Updating and Deleting Data

### Step 7.1: UPDATE Operations

UPDATE changes existing data:

```sql
-- Basic structure
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;  -- CRITICAL: Without WHERE, updates ALL rows!
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Always use WHERE with UPDATE**

Let's see what happens without WHERE:

```sql
-- DON'T RUN THIS - Example of danger
UPDATE projects SET status = 'Cancelled';
-- This would cancel EVERY project!
```

Safe updates:

```sql
-- First, always check what you're about to update
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE project_name = 'Crown Casino Hotel Extension';

-- Then update
UPDATE projects
SET
    status = 'On Hold',
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- Track when changed
WHERE project_name = 'Crown Casino Hotel Extension';

-- Verify the change
SELECT project_name, status, updated_at
FROM projects
WHERE project_name = 'Crown Casino Hotel Extension';
```

**Bulk updates with calculations**:

```sql
-- Give all employees hired before 2022 a 5% raise
-- First, preview who gets affected
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    hire_date,
    salary,
    salary * 1.05 as new_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < '2022-01-01';

-- If looks good, update
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.05
WHERE hire_date < '2022-01-01';

-- Verify
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date;
```

**Using UPDATE with JOINs** (PostgreSQL style):

```sql
-- Update all projects for a specific client
UPDATE projects
SET status = 'On Hold'
FROM clients
WHERE projects.client_id = clients.client_id
    AND clients.company_name = 'Crown Resorts';
```

### Step 7.2: DELETE Operations

DELETE removes rows from a table:

```sql
-- Basic structure
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;  -- CRITICAL: Without WHERE, deletes ALL rows!
```

**Two approaches to deletion**:

**1. Soft Delete (Recommended)**:
```sql
-- Don't actually delete, just mark inactive
UPDATE clients
SET is_active = false
WHERE company_name = 'Test Client';

-- Your queries filter out inactive
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Why soft delete?**
- Can recover from mistakes
- Maintains audit trail
- Preserves referential integrity
- Required for compliance

**2. Hard Delete (Use Carefully)**:
```sql
-- First, always check what you're deleting
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = 'Cancelled';

-- If safe, delete
DELETE FROM projects WHERE status = 'Cancelled';
```

**Testing foreign key protection**:

```sql
-- Try to delete a client that has projects
DELETE FROM clients WHERE client_id = 1;
```

**Expected error**:
```
ERROR: update or delete on table "clients" violates foreign key constraint
```

**This is good!** The database protected you from orphaning projects.

### Step 7.3: Understanding CASCADE Options

When we created foreign keys, we chose what happens on delete:

```sql
-- Let's see our current setup
\d projects
```

Our current settings:
- `ON DELETE RESTRICT` for client_id: Can't delete client with projects
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` for created_by: Can delete employee, created_by becomes NULL

Other options:
- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Delete projects when client deleted (dangerous!)
- `ON DELETE NO ACTION`: Similar to RESTRICT

### ü§î Think About It: Delete Strategies

**Scenario**: A client wants to be removed from your system entirely (GDPR request)

<details>
<summary>What's your deletion strategy?</summary>

Steps to handle this properly:

1. **Check dependencies**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE client_id = ?;
```

2. **Archive data** (for legal requirements):
```sql
-- Create archive tables
CREATE TABLE archived_clients (LIKE clients INCLUDING ALL);
CREATE TABLE archived_projects (LIKE projects INCLUDING ALL);

-- Copy data
INSERT INTO archived_clients SELECT * FROM clients WHERE client_id = ?;
INSERT INTO archived_projects SELECT * FROM projects WHERE client_id = ?;
```

3. **Delete in correct order**:
```sql
BEGIN;  -- Start transaction
DELETE FROM projects WHERE client_id = ?;
DELETE FROM clients WHERE client_id = ?;
COMMIT;  -- Make permanent
```

4. **Or better, anonymize**:
```sql
UPDATE clients
SET
    company_name = 'ANONYMIZED',
    contact_email = 'deleted@example.com',
    phone = NULL,
    address = NULL,
    is_active = false
WHERE client_id = ?;
```
</details>

## Part 8: Security Deep Dive

### Step 8.1: Understanding SQL Injection

SQL injection is the #1 web application security risk. Let's understand it:

**The Attack**:
```python
# Vulnerable code (Python example)
user_input = "'; DROP TABLE clients; --"
query = f"SELECT * FROM clients WHERE company_name = '{user_input}'"
# Becomes: SELECT * FROM clients WHERE company_name = ''; DROP TABLE clients; --'
```

**What happened?**
1. Attacker closed the string with `'`
2. Added their own SQL command
3. Commented out rest with `--`
4. Your table is gone!

### Step 8.2: Preventing SQL Injection

**Method 1: Parameterized Queries (Best)**:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL prepared statements
PREPARE safe_client_search (text) AS
    SELECT * FROM clients WHERE company_name = $1;

-- Use it safely
EXECUTE safe_client_search('Westfield Group');

-- Even with malicious input, it's safe
EXECUTE safe_client_search(''; DROP TABLE clients; --');
-- This searches for literally that string, doesn't execute it!

-- Clean up
DEALLOCATE safe_client_search;
```

**Method 2: Stored Functions**:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_client_by_name(p_name TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE(
    client_id INTEGER,
    company_name VARCHAR,
    contact_email VARCHAR
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT c.client_id, c.company_name, c.contact_email
    FROM clients c
    WHERE c.company_name = p_name;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Use it
SELECT * FROM get_client_by_name('Westfield Group');
```

**Method 3: Input Validation**:

```sql
-- Create a function to validate input
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_company_name(p_name TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Check for suspicious patterns
    IF p_name ~ '[;''"]|(--)|(\/\*)|(\*\/)|xp_|sp_|DROP|DELETE|INSERT|UPDATE' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid characters in company name';
    END IF;
    RETURN TRUE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 8.3: Implementing Audit Logging

Track who does what and when:

```sql
-- Create comprehensive audit log table
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    operation VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    user_name VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT CURRENT_USER,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    row_data JSONB,  -- Store the actual data
    client_ip INET,   -- IP address if available
    application VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT current_setting('application_name')
);

-- Create trigger function for auditing
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- For DELETE, use OLD row. For INSERT/UPDATE, use NEW row
    IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, row_data)
        VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, row_to_json(OLD));
        RETURN OLD;
    ELSE
        INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, row_data)
        VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, row_to_json(NEW));
        RETURN NEW;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Apply to tables we want to audit
CREATE TRIGGER projects_audit_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON projects
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function();

CREATE TRIGGER clients_audit_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON clients
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function();

-- Test it
UPDATE projects SET budget = budget * 1.1 WHERE project_id = 1;

-- View audit log
SELECT
    log_id,
    table_name,
    operation,
    timestamp,
    jsonb_pretty(row_data) as data
FROM audit_log
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Why audit logs matter**:
- **Compliance**: Many regulations require them
- **Security**: Detect unauthorized access
- **Debugging**: Understand what went wrong
- **Recovery**: Can rebuild data from logs

### Step 8.4: User Permissions and Roles

Never use superuser for applications:

```sql
-- Create application user with limited permissions
CREATE USER app_user WITH PASSWORD 'StrongPassword123!';

-- Grant only what's needed
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE arch_firm TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;

-- Create read-only user for reporting
CREATE USER report_user WITH PASSWORD 'AnotherStrongPass456!';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE arch_firm TO report_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO report_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO report_user;

-- Set connection limits
ALTER USER app_user CONNECTION LIMIT 20;
ALTER USER report_user CONNECTION LIMIT 5;

-- Test the restricted user
\c arch_firm app_user
-- Now try something forbidden
DROP TABLE clients;  -- Should fail!
```

### üîí Security Checklist

- [ ] Never use superuser for application connections
- [ ] Use parameterized queries always
- [ ] Implement audit logging on sensitive tables
- [ ] Store passwords as environment variables
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Limit user permissions to minimum needed
- [ ] Regular backups (we'll cover next)
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data in transit (SSL)
- [ ] Keep PostgreSQL updated

## Part 9: Backup and Recovery

### Step 9.1: Why Backups Fail (Learning from Disasters)

**Real disasters that happen**:
- **GitLab (2017)**: Lost 6 hours of data, 5 of 5 backup methods failed
- **Toy Story 2 (1998)**: Pixar accidentally deleted the entire movie
- **Weather.com**: Junior developer dropped production database

**Why backups fail**:
1. **Never tested restore** - Backup corrupted, nobody knew
2. **Same location** - Fire/flood destroys server and backup
3. **No automation** - "We'll backup tomorrow"
4. **No monitoring** - Backups failing silently
5. **Wrong data** - Backing up empty database

### Step 9.2: Creating Your First Backup

```bash
# Exit psql
\q

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ~/architectpro_project/backups
cd ~/architectpro_project

# Method 1: Custom format (best for PostgreSQL)
pg_dump -U postgres -d arch_firm \
    --format=custom \
    --file=backups/arch_firm_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup \
    --verbose

# What flags mean:
# -U postgres: Username
# -d arch_firm: Database name
# --format=custom: PostgreSQL's compressed format
# --file: Output location
# $(date ...): Timestamp in filename
# --verbose: Show progress
```

```bash
# Method 2: Plain SQL (readable, portable)
pg_dump -U postgres -d arch_firm \
    --format=plain \
    --file=backups/arch_firm_readable.sql \
    --no-owner \
    --clean \
    --if-exists

# What flags mean:
# --format=plain: Human-readable SQL
# --no-owner: Don't include ownership commands
# --clean: Include DROP statements
# --if-exists: Don't error if objects don't exist
```

```bash
# Method 3: Specific tables only
pg_dump -U postgres -d arch_firm \
    --table=clients \
    --table=projects \
    --file=backups/critical_tables.sql
```

### Step 9.3: Testing Recovery (CRITICAL!)

**A backup isn't a backup until you've restored it!**

```bash
# Create test database for recovery
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE recovery_test;"

# Method 1: Restore custom format
pg_restore -U postgres \
    --dbname=recovery_test \
    --verbose \
    backups/arch_firm_*.backup

# Method 2: Restore plain SQL
psql -U postgres -d recovery_test < backups/arch_firm_readable.sql

# Verify the restore worked
psql -U postgres -d recovery_test -c "
    SELECT 'clients' as table, COUNT(*) as rows FROM clients
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'projects', COUNT(*) FROM projects
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'employees', COUNT(*) FROM employees;"

# Clean up test database
psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE recovery_test;"
```

### Step 9.4: Automating Backups

Create a backup script `backup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/architectpro_project/backup.sh

# Configuration
DB_NAME="arch_firm"
DB_USER="postgres"
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/architectpro_project/backups"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/${DB_NAME}_${DATE}.backup"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Perform backup
echo "Starting backup of $DB_NAME..."
pg_dump -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME --format=custom --file="$BACKUP_FILE"

# Check if backup succeeded
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup successful: $BACKUP_FILE"

    # Get file size
    SIZE=$(ls -lh "$BACKUP_FILE" | awk '{print $5}')
    echo "Backup size: $SIZE"

    # Delete backups older than 7 days
    find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "*.backup" -mtime +7 -delete
    echo "Old backups cleaned up"
else
    echo "Backup failed!"
    exit 1
fi

# Test the backup (optional but recommended)
echo "Testing backup integrity..."
pg_restore --list "$BACKUP_FILE" > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup integrity verified"
else
    echo "WARNING: Backup may be corrupted!"
fi
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh  # Test it
```

Schedule automatic backups (Linux/Mac):
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line for daily 2 AM backups
0 2 * * * /home/yourusername/architectpro_project/backup.sh >> /home/yourusername/architectpro_project/backup.log 2>&1
```

Windows Task Scheduler equivalent:
```powershell
# Create scheduled task (run as Administrator)
schtasks /create /tn "PostgreSQL Backup" /tr "C:\path\to\backup.bat" /sc daily /st 02:00
```

### Step 9.5: The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

**Industry standard**: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite

```bash
# Local backup (copy 1, media 1)
./backup.sh

# External drive (copy 2, media 2)
cp backups/latest.backup /mnt/external_drive/

# Cloud backup (copy 3, offsite)
# Example with AWS S3
aws s3 cp backups/latest.backup s3://my-bucket/backups/

# Or with rsync to remote server
rsync -avz backups/ user@backup-server:/backups/
```

## Part 10: Aliases & Productivity Boosters

### Step 10.1: Why Aliases Matter

In professional environments, DBAs and developers run the same queries hundreds of times daily. Instead of typing long commands repeatedly, we create shortcuts:

**Benefits of aliases**:
- **Save time**: Type `:tables` instead of `SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables...`
- **Reduce errors**: No typos in complex queries
- **Standardize**: Team uses same shortcuts
- **Muscle memory**: Faster workflow development

### Step 10.2: PostgreSQL psql Shortcuts (\set commands)

Connect to your database and try these:

```sql
-- Create shortcuts for common queries
\set tables 'SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY tablename;'
\set sizes 'SELECT tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(tablename::regclass)) as size FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(tablename::regclass) DESC;'
\set activity 'SELECT pid, usename, datname, state, query_start, SUBSTRING(query, 1, 50) as current_query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state != ''idle'';'
\set locks 'SELECT pid, relation::regclass, mode, granted FROM pg_locks WHERE relation IS NOT NULL;'

-- Now use them!
:tables
:sizes
:activity
```

**What just happened?**
- `\set` creates a psql variable
- Single quotes preserve the SQL
- Double single quotes (`''`) escape quotes inside the string
- `:variable_name` executes the stored command

**Try these useful shortcuts**:

```sql
-- Database health check
\set health 'SELECT current_database() as db, pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as size, (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) as connections;'

-- Find unused indexes
\set unused_indexes 'SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0;'

-- Connection count by database
\set connections 'SELECT datname, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY datname ORDER BY count(*) DESC;'

-- Test them
:health
:connections
```

### Step 10.3: Persistent Configuration with .psqlrc

Create a file `~/.psqlrc` (in your home directory) that runs every time you start psql:

```bash
# Exit psql first
\q

# Create the configuration file
cat > ~/.psqlrc << 'EOF'
-- PostgreSQL client configuration
-- This file is loaded every time you run psql

-- Show query timing
\timing on

-- Better table display for wide tables
\x auto

-- Show NULL values clearly
\pset null '(NULL)'

-- Colorful prompt showing database and user
\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1;33m%]%M %n@%/%R%[%033[0m%]%# '

-- Keep history per database (prevents mixing commands from different projects)
\set HISTFILE ~/.psql_history_:DBNAME

-- Useful shortcuts
\set tables 'SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY tablename;'
\set indexes 'SELECT tablename, indexname, idx_scan as times_used FROM pg_stat_user_indexes ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;'
\set sizes 'SELECT tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(tablename::regclass)) as size FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(tablename::regclass) DESC;'
\set activity 'SELECT pid, usename, application_name, state, query_start, SUBSTRING(query, 1, 60) as current_query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state != ''idle'' ORDER BY query_start;'
\set locks 'SELECT pid, relation::regclass, mode, granted, query FROM pg_locks JOIN pg_stat_activity USING (pid) WHERE relation IS NOT NULL;'
\set cache_hit 'SELECT sum(heap_blks_hit) / NULLIF(sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read), 0) * 100 as cache_hit_percentage FROM pg_statio_user_tables;'

-- Startup message
\echo ''
\echo 'PostgreSQL shortcuts loaded:'
\echo '  :tables    - List all tables'
\echo '  :indexes   - Show index usage'
\echo '  :sizes     - Table sizes'
\echo '  :activity  - Current queries'
\echo '  :locks     - Current locks'
\echo '  :cache_hit - Cache hit ratio'
\echo ''
EOF

# Test your new configuration
psql -U postgres -d arch_firm
```

**You should see**:
- A welcome message with available shortcuts
- Colorful prompt showing database name
- All your shortcuts ready to use

### Step 10.4: Shell Aliases for Common Tasks

Add these to your shell configuration (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
# Exit psql first if you're in it
\q

# Add to your shell config file
cat >> ~/.bashrc << 'EOF'

# PostgreSQL shortcuts
alias dbconnect='psql -U postgres -d arch_firm'
alias dbbackup='pg_dump -U postgres -d arch_firm -F custom -f ~/architectpro_project/backups/arch_firm_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup'
alias dbrestore='pg_restore -U postgres -d arch_firm'
alias dbsize='psql -U postgres -d arch_firm -c "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('"'"'arch_firm'"'"'));"'
alias dbactivity='psql -U postgres -d arch_firm -c "SELECT count(*) as active_connections FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = '"'"'active'"'"';"'
alias dblog='tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log'

EOF

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc

# Test the aliases
dbconnect  # Should connect to your database
```

### Step 10.5: Advanced psql Features

```sql
-- Connect back to your database
-- psql -U postgres -d arch_firm

-- Save query results to file
\o query_results.txt
SELECT * FROM clients;
\o  -- Stop saving to file

-- Execute commands from file
\i my_queries.sql

-- Show query execution plans
\set explain 'EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)'
:explain SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = 'Active';

-- Expanded display toggle
\x  -- Turn on expanded display
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE project_id = 1;
\x  -- Turn off expanded display

-- Copy data to CSV
\copy (SELECT company_name, contact_email FROM clients) TO 'clients.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- Show table structure nicely
\d+ clients  -- + shows more details
```

### üìù Reflection: Productivity Impact

**Question**: How much time do these aliases save in a typical workday?

<details>
<summary>Think about it, then click</summary>

**Conservative estimate for a DBA/Developer**:
- 20 database connections per day: `dbconnect` saves 30 seconds each = 10 minutes
- 5 table size checks: `:sizes` saves 45 seconds each = 3.75 minutes
- 10 activity checks: `:activity` saves 60 seconds each = 10 minutes
- Various other shortcuts = 5 minutes

**Total daily savings**: ~30 minutes
**Annual savings**: 125+ hours (3+ weeks of work!)

Plus reduced mental fatigue from not remembering complex syntax.
</details>

## Part 11: Monitoring and Performance

### Step 11.1: Understanding Database Performance

**Why monitoring matters**:
- Catch problems before users complain
- Plan capacity before running out
- Identify slow queries killing performance
- Detect security issues (unusual access patterns)

### Step 10.2: Essential Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- 1. Current activity - Who's doing what?
SELECT
    pid,
    usename,
    datname as database,
    application_name,
    client_addr,
    state,
    query_start,
    state_change,
    SUBSTRING(query, 1, 100) as current_query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
ORDER BY query_start;

-- What this shows:
-- pid: Process ID
-- state: active/idle/idle in transaction
-- query_start: When query began
-- current_query: What they're running
```

```sql
-- 2. Connection count - Are we hitting limits?
SELECT
    datname as database,
    count(*) as connections,
    max_conn.setting as max_connections,
    ROUND(100.0 * count(*) / max_conn.setting::numeric, 2) as percent_used
FROM pg_stat_activity
CROSS JOIN (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'max_connections') max_conn
GROUP BY datname, max_conn.setting;
```

```sql
-- 3. Table sizes - What's eating disk space?
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS indexes_size,
    n_live_tup as row_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

```sql
-- 4. Cache hit ratio - Is data in memory?
SELECT
    sum(heap_blks_hit) / NULLIF(sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read), 0) AS cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;
-- Should be > 0.90 (90%)
```

```sql
-- 5. Index usage - Are indexes being used?
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan as times_used,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size,
    CASE
        WHEN idx_scan = 0 THEN 'UNUSED - Consider dropping'
        WHEN idx_scan < 100 THEN 'Rarely used'
        ELSE 'Active'
    END as recommendation
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan;
```

### Step 10.3: Creating Monitoring Views

Make monitoring easier with custom views:

```sql
-- Create monitoring schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS monitoring;

-- Overall database health
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW monitoring.database_health AS
SELECT
    current_database() as database_name,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as database_size,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) as total_connections,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') as active_queries,
    (SELECT max(now() - query_start) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') as longest_query_duration,
    (SELECT sum(heap_blks_hit)::numeric / NULLIF(sum(heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read), 0)
     FROM pg_statio_user_tables) as cache_hit_ratio,
    now() as checked_at;

-- Table maintenance needs
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW monitoring.table_maintenance AS
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_live_tup as live_rows,
    n_dead_tup as dead_rows,
    ROUND(n_dead_tup::numeric / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0) * 100, 2) as dead_row_percent,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze,
    CASE
        WHEN n_dead_tup > 1000 AND (n_dead_tup::numeric / NULLIF(n_live_tup, 0)) > 0.2
        THEN 'NEEDS VACUUM'
        ELSE 'OK'
    END as maintenance_needed
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY dead_row_percent DESC;

-- Slow queries (requires pg_stat_statements extension)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

-- Use the views
SELECT * FROM monitoring.database_health;
SELECT * FROM monitoring.table_maintenance;
```

### Step 10.4: Performance Optimization Basics

**EXPLAIN - See how PostgreSQL runs queries**:

```sql
-- See query execution plan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = 'Active';

-- With actual execution times
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = 'Active';

-- Understanding the output:
-- Seq Scan = Reading entire table (slow for large tables)
-- Index Scan = Using index (fast)
-- cost = Estimated work (relative units)
-- rows = Estimated rows returned
-- actual time = Real milliseconds (with ANALYZE)
```

**Creating effective indexes**:

```sql
-- Before index - notice Seq Scan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM projects WHERE budget > 5000000;

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_budget ON projects(budget);

-- After index - should show Index Scan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM projects WHERE budget > 5000000;

-- Compound index for multiple columns
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_status_budget ON projects(status, budget);
```

### Step 10.5: Setting Up Alerts

Create a monitoring script `monitor.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Database monitoring script

DB_NAME="arch_firm"
DB_USER="postgres"
ALERT_EMAIL="admin@architectpro.com"

# Check connection count
CONNECTION_COUNT=$(psql -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -t -c "
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;")

if [ $CONNECTION_COUNT -gt 50 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: High connection count: $CONNECTION_COUNT"
    # In production, send email/Slack alert here
fi

# Check for long-running queries
LONG_QUERIES=$(psql -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -t -c "
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE state = 'active'
    AND now() - query_start > interval '5 minutes';")

if [ $LONG_QUERIES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "ALERT: $LONG_QUERIES queries running over 5 minutes!"
fi

# Check cache hit ratio
CACHE_HIT=$(psql -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -t -c "
    SELECT ROUND(100.0 * sum(heap_blks_hit) /
           NULLIF(sum(heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read), 0), 2)
    FROM pg_statio_user_tables;")

if (( $(echo "$CACHE_HIT < 90" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "WARNING: Cache hit ratio low: $CACHE_HIT%"
fi

# Check table bloat
psql -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "
    SELECT tablename, dead_row_percent
    FROM monitoring.table_maintenance
    WHERE maintenance_needed = 'NEEDS VACUUM';"
```

## Part 12: Enhanced Compliance and Data Governance

### Step 12.1: Why Compliance Matters (Even for Student Projects)

**Reality check**: Even learning projects must consider compliance because:
- **Good habits start early**: Professional practices become second nature
- **Real-world preparation**: Every company deals with compliance
- **Legal requirements**: Many countries have strict data protection laws
- **Career advantage**: Compliance knowledge is highly valued

**The cost of non-compliance**:
- **GDPR fines**: Up to 4% of global revenue (‚Ç¨20M for small companies)
- **Data breaches**: Average cost $4.35 million globally
- **Reputation damage**: Can take years to recover customer trust
- **Legal liability**: Personal lawsuits from affected individuals

### Step 12.2: Understanding PII in Your Database

**What counts as Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?**

Let's audit our ArchitectPro database:

```sql
-- Let's examine what sensitive data we have
SELECT
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    CASE
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%email%' THEN 'PII - Direct identifier'
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%phone%' THEN 'PII - Direct identifier'
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%address%' THEN 'PII - Location data'
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%name%' THEN 'PII - Personal identifier'
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%salary%' THEN 'Sensitive - Financial'
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%hire_date%' THEN 'Sensitive - Employment'
        ELSE 'Review needed'
    END as sensitivity_assessment
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_name IN ('clients', 'employees', 'projects')
ORDER BY
    CASE
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%email%' OR column_name ILIKE '%phone%' THEN 1
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%name%' OR column_name ILIKE '%address%' THEN 2
        WHEN column_name ILIKE '%salary%' THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END,
    table_name, column_name;
```

**Run this and identify**:
- Which fields contain PII?
- What's the sensitivity level of each?
- How should each be protected?

### Step 12.3: GDPR Principles Applied to Your Database

**The 7 GDPR Principles** and how they apply:

#### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency
```sql
-- Document the legal basis for data processing
CREATE TABLE data_processing_purposes (
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    column_name VARCHAR(100),
    purpose VARCHAR(500),
    legal_basis VARCHAR(200),
    retention_period INTEGER,
    data_subject_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    PRIMARY KEY (table_name, column_name)
);

INSERT INTO data_processing_purposes VALUES
('clients', 'contact_email', 'Client communication and contract management', 'Contract performance', 2555, true),
('clients', 'phone', 'Urgent project communication', 'Contract performance', 2555, true),
('employees', 'email', 'Employment relationship management', 'Contract performance', 2555, false),
('employees', 'salary', 'Payroll and HR management', 'Legal obligation', 2555, false);
```

#### 2. Purpose Limitation
```sql
-- Ensure we only use data for stated purposes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_data_usage(
    p_table_name VARCHAR,
    p_column_name VARCHAR,
    p_intended_use VARCHAR
) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
    allowed_purposes TEXT[];
BEGIN
    SELECT ARRAY[purpose] INTO allowed_purposes
    FROM data_processing_purposes
    WHERE table_name = p_table_name AND column_name = p_column_name;

    IF p_intended_use = ANY(allowed_purposes) THEN
        RETURN true;
    ELSE
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Data usage "%" not permitted for %.%', p_intended_use, p_table_name, p_column_name;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 3. Data Minimization
```sql
-- Review what data we actually need
SELECT
    c.table_name,
    c.column_name,
    CASE
        WHEN s.column_name IS NOT NULL THEN 'USED'
        ELSE 'UNUSED - Consider removing'
    END as usage_status
FROM information_schema.columns c
LEFT JOIN (
    -- This would normally check actual query logs
    SELECT DISTINCT 'contact_email' as column_name UNION
    SELECT 'company_name' UNION
    SELECT 'phone' UNION
    SELECT 'first_name' UNION
    SELECT 'last_name' UNION
    SELECT 'role'
) s ON c.column_name = s.column_name
WHERE c.table_schema = 'public'
    AND c.table_name IN ('clients', 'employees');
```

#### 4. Accuracy
```sql
-- Implement data validation and update tracking
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN last_verified TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN verification_method VARCHAR(100);

-- Function to mark data as verified
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION verify_client_data(
    p_client_id INTEGER,
    p_verification_method VARCHAR
) RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE clients
    SET last_verified = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        verification_method = p_verification_method,
        updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE client_id = p_client_id;

    -- Log verification
    INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, row_data)
    VALUES ('clients', 'DATA_VERIFIED', jsonb_build_object(
        'client_id', p_client_id,
        'method', p_verification_method,
        'timestamp', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    ));
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 5. Storage Limitation
```sql
-- Automated data retention
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_expired_data()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Archive old audit logs
    INSERT INTO audit_log_archive
    SELECT * FROM audit_log
    WHERE timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '90 days';

    DELETE FROM audit_log
    WHERE timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '90 days';

    -- Mark inactive clients for review
    UPDATE clients
    SET is_active = false
    WHERE last_verified < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2 years'
    AND is_active = true;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Data cleanup completed at %', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality
```sql
-- Data encryption for sensitive fields
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

-- Function to encrypt sensitive data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION encrypt_sensitive_data(data TEXT)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN encode(
        encrypt(data::bytea, 'your-secret-key', 'aes'),
        'base64'
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Function to decrypt (for authorized access only)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION decrypt_sensitive_data(encrypted_data TEXT)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN convert_from(
        decrypt(decode(encrypted_data, 'base64'), 'your-secret-key', 'aes'),
        'SQL_ASCII'
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

#### 7. Accountability
```sql
-- Comprehensive compliance reporting
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW compliance_dashboard AS
SELECT
    'PII Fields Identified' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as value
FROM data_processing_purposes
WHERE column_name ILIKE '%email%' OR column_name ILIKE '%phone%' OR column_name ILIKE '%name%'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Data Processing Purposes Documented',
    COUNT(*)
FROM data_processing_purposes
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Audit Log Entries (Last 7 Days)',
    COUNT(*)
FROM audit_log
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 days'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Clients Due for Data Verification',
    COUNT(*)
FROM clients
WHERE last_verified < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 year' OR last_verified IS NULL;

-- View the compliance status
SELECT * FROM compliance_dashboard;
```

### Step 12.4: ISO 27001 Information Security Context

**ISO 27001** provides the framework for information security management. Key controls relevant to databases:

```sql
-- Access control matrix (ISO 27001 Control A.9.1.2)
CREATE TABLE access_control_matrix (
    user_role VARCHAR(50),
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    permission_type VARCHAR(20),
    granted BOOLEAN,
    business_justification TEXT,
    approved_by VARCHAR(100),
    approval_date TIMESTAMP,
    review_date TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_role, table_name, permission_type)
);

INSERT INTO access_control_matrix VALUES
('architect', 'projects', 'SELECT', true, 'Need to view assigned projects', 'IT Manager', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1 year'),
('architect', 'clients', 'SELECT', true, 'Need client info for project work', 'IT Manager', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1 year'),
('architect', 'employees', 'SELECT', false, 'No business need', 'IT Manager', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1 year'),
('hr_staff', 'employees', 'ALL', true, 'HR management duties', 'HR Director', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1 year'),
('accountant', 'projects', 'SELECT', true, 'Budget and billing', 'Finance Manager', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1 year');

-- Security incident logging (ISO 27001 Control A.16.1.4)
CREATE TABLE security_incidents (
    incident_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    incident_type VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    affected_systems VARCHAR(200),
    data_compromised BOOLEAN,
    pii_affected BOOLEAN,
    detected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    reported_by VARCHAR(100),
    severity VARCHAR(20),
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'OPEN',
    resolution TEXT,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Simulate detecting suspicious activity
INSERT INTO security_incidents (incident_type, description, affected_systems, pii_affected, reported_by, severity)
VALUES ('Suspicious Login', 'Multiple failed login attempts from unknown IP', 'arch_firm database', true, 'monitoring_system', 'MEDIUM');
```

### Step 12.5: Practical Compliance Implementation

**Create a data subject access request handler** (GDPR Article 15):

```sql
-- Function to export all data for a specific client (GDPR compliance)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION export_client_data(p_client_id INTEGER)
RETURNS JSONB AS $$
DECLARE
    client_data JSONB;
    project_data JSONB;
    audit_data JSONB;
BEGIN
    -- Get client information
    SELECT to_jsonb(c) INTO client_data
    FROM clients c
    WHERE client_id = p_client_id;

    -- Get related project data
    SELECT jsonb_agg(to_jsonb(p)) INTO project_data
    FROM projects p
    WHERE client_id = p_client_id;

    -- Get audit trail
    SELECT jsonb_agg(to_jsonb(a)) INTO audit_data
    FROM audit_log a
    WHERE row_data->>'client_id' = p_client_id::TEXT;

    -- Return comprehensive data export
    RETURN jsonb_build_object(

### üìù Reflection: Compliance in Practice

**Question**: A client emails requesting deletion of all their data under GDPR "Right to be Forgotten". What steps do you take?

<details>
<summary>Think through the process, then click</summary>

**Step-by-step process**:

1. **Verify Identity**: Confirm the request is from authorized person
2. **Check Exceptions**: Can we legally retain any data?
3. **Impact Assessment**: What data will be affected?
4. **Create Data Export**: Before deletion, export for compliance record
5. **Execute Deletion/Anonymization**: Remove or anonymize data
6. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure all related data is addressed
7. **Document Process**: Record what was done for audit trail
8. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform relevant teams
9. **Monitor**: Check for any missed data in future queries

**SQL Implementation**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create the deletion/anonymization function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_gdpr_deletion(
    p_client_id INTEGER,
    p_confirmation_code TEXT
) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
-- Implementation as shown in previous examples
END;
```
</details>

## Part 13: Compliance and Data Governance

### Step 13.1: Understanding Data Privacy Regulations

**Major regulations you should know**:
- **GDPR** (Europe): Strict rules on personal data
- **CCPA** (California): Similar to GDPR for CA residents
- **PIPEDA** (Canada): Privacy for commercial activities
- **Privacy Act** (Australia): Regulates government data handling

**Key principles**:
1. **Consent**: Must have permission to store personal data
2. **Purpose limitation**: Only use data for stated purpose
3. **Data minimization**: Only collect what you need
4. **Accuracy**: Keep data up to date
5. **Storage limitation**: Delete when no longer needed
6. **Security**: Protect against breaches
7. **Accountability**: Document compliance

### Step 11.2: Identifying and Classifying Data

```sql
-- Create data classification system
CREATE TABLE data_classification (
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    column_name VARCHAR(100),
    data_type VARCHAR(50),
    classification VARCHAR(50),
    contains_pii BOOLEAN,
    sensitivity_level VARCHAR(20),
    retention_days INTEGER,
    encryption_required BOOLEAN,
    notes TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (table_name, column_name)
);

-- Classify your data
INSERT INTO data_classification VALUES
-- PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
('clients', 'contact_email', 'Email', 'PII', true, 'HIGH', 2555, true, 'GDPR regulated'),
('clients', 'phone', 'Phone', 'PII', true, 'MEDIUM', 2555, false, 'Optional field'),
('employees', 'email', 'Email', 'PII', true, 'HIGH', 2555, true, 'Login credential'),
('employees', 'first_name', 'Name', 'PII', true, 'MEDIUM', 2555, false, 'Combined with last_name'),
('employees', 'last_name', 'Name', 'PII', true, 'MEDIUM', 2555, false, 'Combined with first_name'),

-- Sensitive business data
('employees', 'salary', 'Financial', 'CONFIDENTIAL', false, 'HIGH', 2555, true, 'HR only'),
('projects', 'budget', 'Financial', 'INTERNAL', false, 'MEDIUM', 1825, false, 'Business sensitive'),

-- Public/Low sensitivity
('projects', 'project_type', 'Category', 'PUBLIC', false, 'LOW', 1825, false, 'Can be disclosed'),
('clients', 'country', 'Location', 'PUBLIC', false, 'LOW', 2555, false, 'General location only');

-- Query to find all PII
SELECT
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    sensitivity_level,
    retention_days / 365.0 as retention_years
FROM data_classification
WHERE contains_pii = true
ORDER BY sensitivity_level DESC;
```

### Step 11.3: Implementing Data Protection

```sql
-- Function to mask sensitive data for non-production
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mask_pii(
    input_text TEXT,
    mask_type VARCHAR DEFAULT 'email'
) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
    CASE mask_type
        WHEN 'email' THEN
            -- Show first 2 chars and domain
            RETURN SUBSTRING(input_text FROM 1 FOR 2) ||
                   '****@' ||
                   SPLIT_PART(input_text, '@', 2);
        WHEN 'phone' THEN
            -- Show area code only
            RETURN SUBSTRING(input_text FROM 1 FOR 3) || '-XXX-XXXX';
        WHEN 'name' THEN
            -- Show first letter only
            RETURN SUBSTRING(input_text FROM 1 FOR 1) || '***';
        ELSE
            RETURN 'MASKED';
    END CASE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create view with masked data for developers
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW clients_masked AS
SELECT
    client_id,
    company_name,
    mask_pii(contact_email, 'email') as contact_email,
    mask_pii(phone, 'phone') as phone,
    'REDACTED' as address,  -- Full redaction for addresses
    country,
    created_at,
    is_active
FROM clients;

-- Test the masking
SELECT * FROM clients_masked LIMIT 3;
```

### Step 11.4: Right to be Forgotten (GDPR Article 17)

```sql
-- Procedure to handle deletion requests
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_deletion_request(
    p_client_id INTEGER,
    p_confirmation_code TEXT
) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
    v_expected_code TEXT;
    v_project_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Generate expected confirmation code
    v_expected_code := 'DELETE-CLIENT-' || p_client_id;

    -- Verify confirmation
    IF p_confirmation_code != v_expected_code THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid confirmation code. Expected: %', v_expected_code;
    END IF;

    -- Check for active projects
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_project_count
    FROM projects
    WHERE client_id = p_client_id AND status = 'Active';

    IF v_project_count > 0 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot delete: % active projects exist', v_project_count;
    END IF;

    -- Archive before deletion
    INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, operation, row_data)
    SELECT 'clients', 'GDPR_DELETE', row_to_json(c)
    FROM clients c WHERE client_id = p_client_id;

    -- Anonymize rather than delete (maintains referential integrity)
    UPDATE clients SET
        company_name = 'ANONYMIZED-' || client_id,
        contact_email = 'deleted-' || client_id || '@example.com',
        phone = NULL,
        address = NULL,
        is_active = false
    WHERE client_id = p_client_id;

    RETURN 'Client ' || p_client_id || ' has been anonymized per GDPR request';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Test the function
SELECT handle_deletion_request(1, 'DELETE-CLIENT-1');
-- Will fail due to active projects

-- Check the result
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE client_id = 1;
```

### Step 11.5: Data Retention Policy

```sql
-- Create retention policy tracking
CREATE TABLE retention_policy (
    policy_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    retention_days INTEGER,
    last_cleanup TIMESTAMP,
    next_cleanup TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS
        (last_cleanup + (retention_days || ' days')::INTERVAL) STORED
);

INSERT INTO retention_policy (table_name, retention_days, last_cleanup) VALUES
('audit_log', 90, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
('projects', 2555, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),  -- 7 years
('clients', 2555, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

-- Procedure to clean old audit logs
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_old_data()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Delete old audit logs
    DELETE FROM audit_log
    WHERE timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '90 days';

    -- Archive completed projects older than 7 years
    INSERT INTO archived_projects
    SELECT * FROM projects
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    AND end_date < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 years';

    DELETE FROM projects
    WHERE status = 'Completed'
    AND end_date < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 years';

    -- Update last cleanup
    UPDATE retention_policy
    SET last_cleanup = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE table_name IN ('audit_log', 'projects');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Part 12: Professional Practices and Automation

### Step 12.1: Database Migrations

Professional teams version their database changes:

```sql
-- Create migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
    version VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT,
    author VARCHAR(100),
    executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    execution_time_ms INTEGER,
    checksum VARCHAR(64),
    rollback_sql TEXT
);

-- Record your initial setup as version 1.0.0
INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version, description, author)
VALUES ('1.0.0', 'Initial schema: clients, employees, projects tables', 'Your Name');

-- Example migration: Add new column
-- Save as migrations/1.1.0_add_client_rating.sql

-- Migration 1.1.0: Add client rating
BEGIN;

-- Add the column
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN rating INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE clients ADD CONSTRAINT valid_rating
    CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5);

-- Backfill existing data
UPDATE clients SET rating = 3 WHERE rating IS NULL;

-- Record migration
INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version, description, author, rollback_sql)
VALUES (
    '1.1.0',
    'Add client rating column',
    'Your Name',
    'ALTER TABLE clients DROP COLUMN rating;'
);

COMMIT;
```

### Step 12.2: Database Functions and Procedures

Encapsulate business logic in the database:

```sql
-- Function to calculate project profitability
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_project_metrics(p_project_id INTEGER)
RETURNS TABLE (
    project_name VARCHAR,
    duration_days INTEGER,
    daily_burn_rate NUMERIC,
    days_until_budget_exhausted INTEGER,
    is_on_track BOOLEAN
) AS $$
DECLARE
    v_project RECORD;
BEGIN
    SELECT * INTO v_project
    FROM projects
    WHERE project_id = p_project_id;

    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        v_project.project_name,
        (v_project.end_date - v_project.start_date)::INTEGER as duration_days,
        ROUND(v_project.budget / NULLIF(v_project.end_date - v_project.start_date, 0), 2) as daily_burn_rate,
        ROUND(v_project.budget / NULLIF(
            v_project.budget / NULLIF(v_project.end_date - v_project.start_date, 0),
            0))::INTEGER as days_until_budget_exhausted,
        v_project.end_date > CURRENT_DATE as is_on_track;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Use the function
SELECT * FROM calculate_project_metrics(1);
```

### Step 12.3: Advanced psql Configuration

Create `~/.psqlrc` for productivity:

```sql
-- ~/.psqlrc - PostgreSQL client configuration

-- Timing for all queries
\timing on

-- Expanded output for wide tables
\x auto

-- Better null display
\pset null '(NULL)'

-- History per database
\set HISTFILE ~/.psql_history_:DBNAME

-- Prompt customization
\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1;33m%]%M %n@%/%R%[%033[0m%]%# '

-- Useful shortcuts
\set tables 'SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY tablename;'
\set locks 'SELECT pid, relation::regclass, mode, granted FROM pg_locks WHERE relation IS NOT NULL;'
\set activity 'SELECT pid, usename, application_name, state, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state != ''idle'';'
\set dbsize 'SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));'

-- Show commands on startup
\echo 'Custom commands available:'
\echo '  :tables     - Show all tables'
\echo '  :locks      - Show current locks'
\echo '  :activity   - Show active queries'
\echo '  :dbsize     - Show database size'
```

### Step 12.4: Documentation Generation

```sql
-- Generate documentation for your schema
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_schema_documentation()
RETURNS TABLE (
    documentation TEXT
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT '# Database Schema Documentation' ||
           E'\nGenerated: ' || CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ||
           E'\n\n## Tables\n'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT '### ' || tablename || E'\n' ||
           'Description: [Add description here]' || E'\n' ||
           'Columns:' || E'\n'
    FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT '- **' || column_name || '** (' || data_type ||
           CASE WHEN is_nullable = 'NO' THEN ', NOT NULL' ELSE '' END ||
           ')' || E'\n'
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Generate and save documentation
\o schema_documentation.md
SELECT * FROM generate_schema_documentation();
\o
```

## üéØ Final Assessment: Putting It All Together

### Comprehensive Challenge

Create a complete report showing:

```sql
-- 1. Database overview
SELECT
    'Database Size' as metric,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as value
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Tables', COUNT(*)::TEXT
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Indexes', COUNT(*)::TEXT
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Rows (All Tables)', SUM(n_live_tup)::TEXT
FROM pg_stat_user_tables;

-- 2. Business metrics
WITH project_stats AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) as total_projects,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as active_projects,
        SUM(budget) as total_budget,
        AVG(budget) as avg_budget
    FROM projects
)
SELECT * FROM project_stats;

-- 3. Data quality check
SELECT
    'Orphaned Projects' as issue,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.client_id
WHERE c.client_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Duplicate Emails',
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT contact_email)
FROM clients;

-- 4. Security audit
SELECT
    'Failed Login Attempts' as security_metric,
    SUM(failed_login_attempts) as total
FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Inactive Accounts',
    COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE is_active = true
AND last_login < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

## üìù Final Reflection Questions

Answer these to solidify your understanding:

1. **Why Relational?**
   - When would you choose PostgreSQL over NoSQL (MongoDB)?
   - What types of applications need ACID guarantees?

2. **Constraints vs Application Logic?**
   - Why enforce rules in the database rather than application code?
   - What happens if you have multiple applications using the same database?

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Your daily backup at 2 AM fails on Tuesday. You don't notice until Thursday. What's your recovery plan?
   - How would you minimize data loss?

4. **Security Incident**
   - You notice 1000 failed login attempts in your audit log from an unknown IP. What steps do you take?
   - How do you prevent this in the future?

5. **Performance Problem**
   - Users complain the system is slow. What queries would you run first to diagnose?
   - How do you identify if it's a database issue or application issue?

6. **Compliance Request**
   - A user requests all their data under GDPR. How do you gather it from multiple related tables?
   - How do you ensure you've found everything?

7. **Real-World Trade-offs**
   - When would you choose soft delete over hard delete?
   - When would you denormalize data intentionally?

8. **Professional Growth**
   - What aspect of databases do you want to learn more about?
   - How would you explain the importance of referential integrity to a non-technical manager?

- **Query Optimization**: Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to tune performance

#### Professional Tools
- **Migration Scripts**: Versioned schema changes with rollback capability
- **Stored Procedures**: Business logic in the database layer
- **Triggers**: Automatic data validation and audit logging
- **Views & Materialized Views**: Pre-computed results for reporting

**Why This Progression Matters**: You're building skills in the same order professional developers do - foundations first, then complexity. Each Phase 2 concept builds on what you've mastered in Phase 1.

### Skills You'll Gain
By the end of Phase 2, you'll be able to:
- ‚úÖ Design complex relational schemas
- ‚úÖ Implement enterprise security controls
- ‚úÖ Write optimized queries for large datasets
